	<h4>Text Editor</h4>
	<p>The text editor I chose is VIM. I chose VIM because I have seen many programmers use it and have heard great things about it. I worked through the tutorial included with VIM (vimtutor) because it was 1) easy to access and 2) extremely interactive.</p>
	<p>The tutorial covered how to navigate VIM using the 'hjkl' keys, the G operation to jump to specific line numbers, and using the 'w$0' keys to navigate along a line. It also covered the commands used for deleting, replacing, copying, and pasting text; these are all 'Normal Mode' commands. Along with these it covered writing (saving) the file, inserting contents of another file into the current one, and also running shell commands from within the VIM. Overall, the tutorial showed me that VIM is a very powerful text editor and I plan to  use it for the majority of my career as a computer scientist.</p>
	<p>This is my second paragraph</p>
