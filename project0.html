	<h4>Text Editor</h4>
	<p>The text editor I chose is VIM. I chose VIM because I have seen many programmers use it and have heard great things about it. I worked through the tutorial included with VIM (vimtutor) because it was 1) easy to access and 2) extremely interactive.</p>
	<p>The tutorial covered how to navigate VIM using the 'hjkl' keys, the G operation to jump to specific line numbers, and using the 'we$0' keys to navigate along a line. It also covered the commands used for deleting, replacing, copying, and pasting text; these are all 'Normal Mode' commands. Along with these it covered writing (saving) the file, inserting contents of another file into the current one, and also running shell commands from within the VIM. Overall, the tutorial showed me that VIM is a very powerful text editor and I plan to  use it for the majority of my career as a computer scientist.</p>
	
	<h4>Version Control System</h4>
	<p>The VCS I chose is git. I chose git because it is the most popular VCS on the market and I have used it before, although not extensively. I watched <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Welcome/409275/416541-4.html">this</a> tutorial from Lynda.com in its entirety to learn about using git locally and then watched a bit of Chapter 13 from <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Using-local-remote-repositories/100222/111327-4.html?autoplay=true">this</a> tutorial, also from Lynda.com, to learn about using github repositories.</p>
	<p>The first tutorial covered how to setup a local git repository, track and stage files, and make commits. It also briefly covered branching and how to merge branches. Chapter 13 of the second tutorial discussed creating and using a github repository. This is an online repository that can be accessed by anyone (or any machine) by 'pulling' those files onto a local machine. </p>
	
	<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
	<p>The next thing I would like to learn about vim is how to include plugins. I briefly researched a plugin called snipMate that formats multiple programming languages within vim and also supports auto-complete commands, however, I couldn't quite figure out how to get it working.</p>
	<p>The next thing I'd like to learn about git is cloning an already existing repository onto my local machine so I can checkout other people's projects.</p>
	<p>I currently have 7 commits logged with git and will probably end up with 8 when I am finished. I think this is too many commits for such a small project and I would probably do fewer commits next time. Since I use a PC and a laptop, I will continue to commit my project whenever I leave one to use the other.</p>
